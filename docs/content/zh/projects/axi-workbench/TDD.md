## 2026-08-07 同步记录

项目根 `TDD.md` 为 builder-friendly stub。权威 TDD 位于 `docs/state/TDD.md`（架构假设 + 测试曲面映射 + 逐面验证 + 风险用例）。Web 管理端与移动应用现在有独立的合同校验与验证路径。


# Axi Workbench — TDD Slice

> Axi Docs TDD slice for **Axi Workbench**. Describes the test design for the dossier itself, not the project.

## Unit checks

- `pnpm --dir app projects:check` walks `docs/content/{en,zh}/projects/axi-workbench/README.md, AGENTS.md, INDEX.md, TODO.md, MILESTONE.md, PRD.md, TDD.md` and asserts every expected piece exists with valid frontmatter.
- `pnpm --dir app projects:check --project=axi-workbench` runs the same checks scoped to this project.

## Manual checks

- Open the dossier in the Axi Docs web app and confirm it routes under `/en/projects/axi-workbench` (and `/zh/...`).
- Verify the knowledge graph renders a node for this project (graph-title and graph-tags must be unique enough).

## Failure modes

- Missing piece → `projects:check` exits non-zero with the missing path in the error.
- Stale purpose statement → re-run `projects:build` to regenerate from `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md`.
- Stale project root path → update `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md` first; the dossier follows.
