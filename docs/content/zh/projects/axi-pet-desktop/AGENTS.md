Owns the macOS-first desktop-pet app and a self-contained set of Stage/electron/contract packages. Namespace locked to @axi-pet-desktop/* (legacy @proj-airi/* packages migrated 2026-07-17). Remote publication pending owner sign-off (see remote_decision_pending). Lineage: fork of axi-pet, sharing the moeru-ai/airi upstream.

# Axi Pet Desktop — Agent Contract

> This dossier is the Axi Docs agent contract for **Axi Pet Desktop** (workspace path: `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-pet-desktop`).
> It does not replace the project root `AGENTS.md`. The project root always wins for project-local rules; this file only documents how Axi Docs *presents* the project.

## Read Order

1. This file (dossier).
2. `docs/content/{en,zh}/projects/axi-pet-desktop/README.md` (dossier summary).
3. Project root `AGENTS.md` at `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-pet-desktop/AGENTS.md`.
4. Project root `README.md` at `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-pet-desktop/README.md`.

## Boundary

- Axi Docs treats this project as **read-only content source**.
- Axi Docs never edits files under `/Volumes/code/workspace/projects/axi-pet-desktop`.
- Modifications must be proposed back to the owning project (PR, issue, or owner handoff).

## Update Cadence

- Re-run `pnpm --dir app projects:build` whenever `WORKSPACE_INDEX.md` changes.
- Hand-edit this dossier only when Axi Docs is the *primary* surface for the change (e.g. cross-project summary, MCP tool mapping).
